# LDA from Scratch

This is a simple implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using only NumPy, applied to the Iris dataset.

It projects the data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing class separability.

### Features:

- Implements LDA without scikit-learnâ€™s built-in method
- Works on the Iris dataset
- Visualizes the 2D projection
